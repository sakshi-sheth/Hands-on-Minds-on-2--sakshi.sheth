Problem no.: 52
**Permuted Multiples**
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double,251748,contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.
Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x and 6x contain the same digits.

**OUTPUT**
The smallest positive integer x is: 142857

**Strong Achilles Numbers**
A positive integer n  is powerful if p^2 is a divisor of  n for every prime factor p in n.  A positive integer n is a perfect power if  n can be expressed as a power of another positive integer. A positive integer n  is an Achilles number if n  is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800  are Achilles numbers: 864=2^5.3^3 and  1800= 2^3.3^2.5^2 We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both  S and phy S   are Achilles numbers. For example, 864  is a Strong Achilles number:  phy(864) = 288 = 2^5.3^2. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: phy(1800) = 480 = 2^5.3^1.5^1 There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below  10^4 and 656 below 10^8.
How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 10^18 ? 1 phy  denotes Euler's totient function.

**NOTE**: As 10^18 is large number it was taking a lot of time to run this value so for trial I used 10^6 instead of 10^18.

**OUTPUT**
Count of Strong Achilles numbers below 10^6: 99
